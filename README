map.sh :
	Use TinyRemapper to remap a jar
	Supports official; intermediary, named
	Mapping can be done from:
		official -> intermediary, named
		intermediary -> official, named
		named -> intermediary
	Thus, to go from named to official takes two steps.
	Run with no arguments for usage

How to use :
	Download yarn from Github for the version of Minecraft you would like
	Run ./gradlew yarn
	Run ./gradlew build
	Extract the tiny mapping from the tar.gz archive produced in build
	This provides a mapping containing all three stages
	(official, intermediary, named)
	Next, use map.sh.

	It is also important to extract the library files from the .gradle folder
	in yarn. Save these in a folder which will later be specified (no spaces please).
